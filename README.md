- 👋 Hi, I’m @Amelia-e-cpu
- 👀 I’m interested in everything 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything I can possibly learn. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an app and to also get people to believe that cyber stalking/bulling as well as harassing by means of technology is VERY REAL. I taught myself how to read the language of code. I can read it, understand it but I can't write it. The only thing that led me through here was faith and "proof" unfortunately when cyber stalking is involved if you don't have "proof" no one will believe you. AND IF NO ONE BELIEVES YOU. You CAN'T JUST GIVE UP! You must keep going and prove it. For about two years day in and day out hours on end researching and teaching myself all the ins and outs of the internet. I lost friends, family members, I almost lost my kids! Everyone called me crazy (they still do) but one thing I don't do is GIVE UP! I'm a sore loser. I'm resilient, I'm strong, I'm proud, and I'm confident (although I almost lost site of all of those qualities at times) I never lost FAITH! I will continue to fight for my truth, my respect and for my kids not to believe that their Mom is just "crazy." There is a lot of evil in the dark. I am going to come out finding the light. I am striving each day to teach myself the ways of technology because at the end of the day "technology" is a HUGE PART OF OUR FUTURE! Just like we want our kids safe in the street we should always respect everyone's privacy and especially the privacy of our kids. Our kids need to be safe in the dark.
